The Saxons' strategy
                                for law enforcement was to introduce <em><strong>Tithings</strong></em>, these were small groups of 10 men that were collectively responsible for each other and the capture of criminals.<em>The Church</em> also played
                                a significant role in law enforcement, it helped in determining the accused as guilty or not, the Church had an overarching amount of power in society at the time and specifically with the <em><strong>Trials by Ordeal</strong></em>,
                                these were not <em>punishments</em> but instead a way for the community to determine one's innocence. </p>

                                consisting of men from the village who knew both the accuser and the accused. The accuser and the accused would give their version of events and it was up to the jury to decide who was telling the truth. If there was no
                                clear evidence such as an eyewitness to the crime, the jury decided guilt or innocence based on their knowledge of the people concerned. If the jury felt that the accuser was more honest than the accused, they would swear
                                an oath that the accused was guilty. This oath taking was called <strong><em>compurgation.</em></strong></p>

                                    Not long after William's claim to the English Throne, did he and his men start a castle building project - William utilised Saxon peasants to construct these fortresses for Norman lords. These castles represented power and authority, as well as being
                                    used to keep an eye on people.

                                    The feudal system had been used in France by the Normans from the time they first settled there in about 900AD. It was a simple, but effective system, where all land was owned by the King. One quarter was kept by the King as his personal property, some
                                    was given to the church and the rest was leased out under strict controls, this feudal system was introduced to England following the invasion. This system continued to fortify William's control over england by providing
                                    him, theoretically, absolute power.

                                William declared that large stretches of the English countryside to be <em>'Royal Forests'</em> which he and the wealthy would use for hunting. Land which had been common land was now controlled by the king. Although for
                                peasants it was illegal to hunt, carry weapons or cut down trees - some of the harshest punishment were for breaking these Forest Laws.
